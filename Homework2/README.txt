The modifications that I made in the game are the ones explained in the part 2 of the "Introduction to Scripting" project. In other words, I have implemented the following additional features:
-Visuals (hearts)
-Sound effects
-Keeping score
-User interface
-Tittle, Menu & Passing data between scenes

These implementations are in the "Build" folder along with its corresponding .exe



Additionally, I have introduced a net in the game map, so the sheeps that aren't destroyed don't fall into the void. This implementation, as well as the previous ones, are in the "Build2" folder.



To conclude, there are two Build folders and the Assets folder. Each build folder has an .exe, but "Build" just has the part 2 features and "Build2" not only has these features but also has the net feature.
