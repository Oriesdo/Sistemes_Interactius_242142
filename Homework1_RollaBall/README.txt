The folder contains all the files used to develop the game. Its executable is inside the Builds folder.

The modifications that I have made are:
-Changing the color of the walls
-Introducing some obstacles
-Background sound
-A sound each time a coin is collected

Other modifications I have tried to develop but failed are:
-Making the obstacles move randomly: I ended up having the obstacles at the corners of the plane (I include the script I tried to develop in the corresponding folder).
-Instead of having collectable cubes, I tried to have spheres transformed into some sort of coins, but I failed because the rotation is not the same.
